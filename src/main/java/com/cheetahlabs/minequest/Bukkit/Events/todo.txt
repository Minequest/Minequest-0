Create a CBEntity, CBPlayer, etc... as events are called.
Ex. Entities that die will remove our collection
of QuestEntitys, while entities that are spawned (such as a player
joining the server) will add an entity to our collection.
We can have a QuestManager take care of getting all this.
(This sounds like SpoutPlugin now...)
Have events tell us whether an entity was
destroyed, created, modified, etc...
