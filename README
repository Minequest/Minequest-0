This is version 0 of the MineQuest mod. It is unstable past 1.0 of Minecraft, unusable past 1.1, and was initially a ported version of MineQuest from the hey0 days by the same developer who created MineQuest, jmonk. As of now this version is depreciated; it has become full of hacks and is hard to bug-fix for the team.
